{"name":"Izdusumu","tagline":"A Socio-Economic Ontology Portal","body":"# Background\r\n\r\n## Wiki Site\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at http://izdusumu.org/wiki\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\nThe IzDusumu project inspired by the Occupy Movements that took place across the globe over 2010-2013 period but particularly by the Occupy Gezi Parki protests in Turkey.\r\n\r\nWe make two key observations:\r\n\r\n* choices made by the public that ultimately lead to social unrest and/or an economic crash are mostly dictated by incorrect and/or incomplete dissemination of performance measures of their governing body;\r\n* while most data on the social and economic trends are available from official sources they are not easily accessible or not easily parseable.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nWith the IzDusumu project we aim to address these two issues by creating a trustworthy information portal that:\r\n\r\n* uses data collected from official sources\r\n* provides multi-dimensional social and economic performance criteria of a population\r\n* presents data primarily in graphical format such that lay person can comprehend\r\n\r\nWe recognize that as with any socio-economic analysis effort this project is also related to the political makeup of the target population being analyzed. However, the project is apolitical in nature and aims to provide purely objective and measurable data and let the viewers pass their own judgement.\r\n\r\n## Project Name\r\n\r\nThe name of the project, IzDusumu, is the English-character-only camel-case form of the Turkish term ”İz Düşümü” which means projection. It represents the primary purpose of the project stated above that is to produce a simpler, lower dimensional, graphical presentation of the complex performance trends in a population.","google":"UA-41925049-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
